# MazeGame
This is a maze game made in JavaScript that uses an implementation of Randomized depth-first search to generate it's mazes. I used the p5.js library to create the graphics and implement controls.

## Objectives:
* Collect green coins
* Reach the Goal (yellow)
* Complete in as fast time as you can
